      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p><strong>If you are looking for a hopeful view of the future, you have come to the right place.</strong> We are seeking to use an abstract set of principles to develop new methods of solving social problems.</p>
      <p>The starting point is <em>process thought</em>, which questions the common-sense view that the world is composed of inert stuff and offers instead a vision of a web of feelings and interactive relations in flux in which we participate. Practically, this means we can have the most enduring impact by paying less attention to particular events and more to the context in which they occur.</p>

          <h3>Process Thought in Action</h3>
          <p>We agree with Marx’s insistence that philosophy should change the world, not merely interpret it. We want to show the <strong>practical significance</strong> of process thought and invite you to join us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <span class="badge">Focus</span>
          <p>Process thought has been around for a century (or two, counting its antecedents in Hegel, Fichte, Nietzsche, and Bergson). Too often it has been tucked away in classrooms, without much influence on world events. We aim to change that.</p>
