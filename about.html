    <h2>What IAPT hopes to accomplish</h2>
    <p>The world in 2025 seems to be coming apart at the seams. The problems we face today are radically different from the ones humans have faced throughout most of history. In the past, we struggled against natural elements, but now our problems are mostly reflexive, caused by humans themselves.</p>

    <p>Modern human systems, such as industrial agriculture and massive cities, allow us to thrive, but they also pose tremendous risks. We depend on technologies that have damaging side effects, yet we cannot abandon those technologies because they sustain us.</p>

    <p>To escape from the cage we have built, many groups are devising new modes of thought, but solutions are still centered on individual consciousness. What is needed are new modes of thought that lead to new institutions.</p>

    <p>We at IAPT do not pretend to have answers. We are still trying to formulate better questions. We believe that process philosophy is the most fruitful and comprehensive philosophy available today. It has already proven valuable in promoting interreligious dialogue and recovering forgotten values of traditions. Process thought affirms knowledge from intuition and tradition alongside science.</p>

    <p>We are convinced that process thought can help us achieve insights across many domains, including rethinking social problems that seem insoluble within our current mindset. We seek methodologies that help untie knots within institutions—creating economic justice, restoring food systems, reversing vicious cycles, reconnecting city dwellers with nature, and improving collective mental health.</p>

    <p>Take the problem of addiction, for example. It is usually treated as an individual affliction, but cultural differences show a strong social component. What if we could reduce addiction in a whole population by 25%? Wouldn't that be worth pursuing?</p>

    <p>This is just one example among many. Process thought emphasizes the social nature of human behavior and offers tools for cultural and institutional transformation.</p>

    <p>The purpose of IAPT is to explore such possibilities so that process thought might serve a broader range of issues and concerns than it has until now.</p>

    <p>For now, we are just getting started, and this website is under construction. If you are inspired and want to contribute, please write to us at
