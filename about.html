      <h2>What IAPT hopes to accomplish</h2>

      <p>The world in 2025 seems to be coming apart at the seams. The problems that we face today are radically different from the ones that humans have faced throughout most of history. In the past, we mostly struggled against natural elements, but now our problems are mostly reflexive, caused by humans.</p>

      <p>Modern human systems—industrial agriculture, massive cities—allow us to thrive, but they also pose tremendous risks. We depend on technologies that have damaging side effects, yet we cannot abandon them because they sustain us.</p>

      <p>To escape the cage we have built, many groups devise new modes of thought, but their solutions often stay within the orbit of individual consciousness. What is needed are new modes of thought that lead to new institutions. Millions may change consciousness, yet institutions remain mired in old habits.</p>

      <p>We at IAPT do not pretend to have answers. At present, we are still trying to formulate better questions. We believe that process philosophy (also called constructive postmodernism or the philosophy of organism) is today’s most fruitful and comprehensive philosophy. It has proven valuable in promoting interreligious dialogue, helping people learn from others’ insights and recover forgotten values in their own traditions. Process thought affirms knowledge from intuition and tradition alongside science.</p>

      <p>We are convinced that process thought can help us gain insights across many domains, not just interreligious dialogue or tradition-building. Specifically, we seek ways to reconfigure our understanding of social problems that seem insoluble within our present frame of mind.</p>

      <p>We are seeking methodologies that might help us untie knots within institutions—so that we might create economic justice, restore healthy food systems (from farm to fork), reverse vicious cycles in social dynamics, promote effective small-group decision-making, interrupt the preconditions of socially conditioned racism, reconnect city dwellers with nature, and improve mental health at the cultural level.</p>

      <h3>An example: addiction</h3>
      <p>Addiction is mostly treated as an individual affliction. Yet rates and types of addiction vary greatly across cultures, implying a social component. Because of a philosophical bias in modern science, the social dimensions of addiction are undertheorized and rarely treated. Mental-health institutions are largely clinical, oriented around the recovery of individuals. What if we could take action that reduces the incidence of addiction in an entire population by 25%? Wouldn’t that be worth pursuing?</p>

      <p>This is one example among dozens where incremental, population-level improvement might be possible if researchers looked for ways to heal entire cultures or economies, not just individuals. Process thought is unusually aligned with this collective approach because it emphasizes the social nature of human behavior. While many theories note social conditioning, process thought takes that principle to a new level.</p>

      <p>Because process thought developed in the U.S. largely within religious studies, it has been slow to tackle the mundane tasks of social improvement that it could foster. The purpose of IAPT is to explore these possibilities so that process thought can serve a broader range of issues and concerns than it has until now.</p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Background:</strong> Our starting point is process thought, which questions the view that the world is inert matter with properties, and instead offers a vision of a web of feelings and interactive relations in flux in which we participate. Practically, this means focusing less on isolated events and more on the contexts that shape them. We agree with the view that philosophy should be active in the world, not just a quiet observer.
